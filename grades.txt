comments:
excellent presentation of code, very well written specs and testing strategy ! good job. 
your project runs perfectly well and passes all the tests or fails with decent error message. 

the only section you lost points in is your original design document. 
it has both grammar and data type, but an overview of the system was missing. 
final design is a lot better. design decisions are thoroughly documented. 
but you can still do better. try to improve the opening section and how you start introducing your solution.
